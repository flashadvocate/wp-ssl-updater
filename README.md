#WordPress SSL Updater Thingy
This is a very primitive script intended to be used to update specific options (siteurl and home) in a WordPress multisite configuration. Specifically, it looks for 'http://' values and makes them 'https://'. That's it.

###Usage
This has morphed into being integrated as a slack command.
